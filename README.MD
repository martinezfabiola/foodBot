This sample shows how to create a bot that uses Language Understanding (LUIS). This bot example uses [`restify`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/restify) and [`dotenv`](https://npmjs.com/package/dotenv). 

# Concepts introduced in this sample
[Language Understanding (LUIS)](https://www.luis.ai) is a cloud-based API service that applies custom machine-learning intelligence to a user's conversational, natural language text to predict overall meaning, and pull out relevant, detailed information.

In this sample, we demonstrate how to call LUIS to extract the intents from a user's message.

# To try this sample
- Clone the repository
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-samples.git
    ```
- In a console, navigate to samples/javascript_nodejs/12.nlp-with-luis
    ```bash
    cd samples/javascript_nodejs/12.nlp-with-luis
    ```
- [Optional] Update the .env file under samples/javascript_nodejs/12.nlp-with-luis with your botFileSecret
    For Azure Bot Service bots, you can find the botFileSecret under application settings.
- Install modules and start the bot
    ```bash
    npm i && npm start
    ```
    Alternatively you can also use nodemon via
    ```bash
    npm i && npm run watch
    ```

# Testing the bot using Bot Framework Emulator
[Microsoft Bot Framework Emulator](https://github.com/microsoft/botframework-emulator) is a desktop application that allows bot developers to test and debug their bots on localhost or running remotely through a tunnel.

- Install the Bot Framework Emulator from [here](https://aka.ms/botframework-emulator)

## Connect to bot using Bot Framework Emulator V4
- Launch Bot Framework Emulator
- File -> Open Bot Configuration and navigate to samples/javascript_nodejs/12.nlp-with-luis folder
- Select nlp-with-luis.bot file

## Prerequisites
### Set up LUIS
- Navigate to [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai).
- Click the `Sign in` button.
- Click on `My Apps`.
- Click on the `Import new app` button.
- Click on the `Choose File` and select [reminders.json](cognitiveModels/reminders.json) from the `BotBuilder-Samples/javascript_nodejs/12.nlp-with-luis/cognitiveModels` folder.
- Update [nlp-with-luis.bot](nlp-with-luis.bot) file with your AppId, SubscriptionKey, Region and Version. 
    You can find this information under "Publish" tab for your LUIS application at [LUIS portal](https://www.luis.ai).  For example, for
https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/luis/v2.0/apps/{LuisAppID}?subscription-key={LuisSubscriptionKey}&verbose=true&timezoneOffset=0&q=

    The Version is listed on the page.
    Note: Enter the either "authoringKey" OR "subscriptionKey", not both.
    [See an example .bot service configuration for using LUIS here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-howto-v4-luis?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&tabs=js#configure-your-bot-to-use-your-luis-app).    

- Update [index.js](index.js) and set the `LUIS_CONFIGURATION` value to match the `name` field in your service declaration.

- Update [nlp-with-luis.bot](nlp-with-luis.bot) file with your Authoring Key.  
    You can find this under your user settings at [luis.ai](https://www.luis.ai).  Click on your name in the upper right hand corner of the portal, and click on the "Settings" menu option.

    NOTE: Once you publish your app on LUIS portal for the first time, it may take some time to go live.

- Your .bot file should now include an item in the services array that looks like this:

```javascript
{
    "type":"luis",
    "name":"<some name>",
    "appId":"<an app id>",
    "version":"<a version number>",
    "authoringKey":"<your authoring key>",
    "subscriptionKey":"<your subscription key>",
    "region":"<region>",
    "id":"<some number>"
}
```

### (Optional) Install `ludown` and `luis`
- Install the `ludown` CLI tool [here](https://aka.ms/using-ludown) to help describe language understanding components for your bot.
- Install the `luis` CLI tool [here](https://aka.ms/using-luis-cli) to create and manage your LUIS applications.

# LUIS
Language Understanding service (LUIS) allows your application to understand what a person wants in their own words. LUIS uses machine learning to allow developers to build applications that can receive user input in natural language and extract meaning from it.

# Deploy this bot to Azure
You can use the [MSBot](https://github.com/microsoft/botbuilder-tools) Bot Builder CLI tool to clone and configure any services this sample depends on. 

To install all Bot Builder tools - 

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.5 or higher

```bash
npm i -g msbot chatdown ludown qnamaker luis-apis botdispatch luisgen
```

To clone this bot, run
```
msbot clone services -f deploymentScripts/msbotClone -n <BOT-NAME> -l <Azure-location> --subscriptionId <Azure-subscription-id>
```
